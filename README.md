# Get_Next_Line

What is get_next_line?

get_next_line is an individual project at 42 that basically reads a file line by line.

Disclaimer: There are so many easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my libft and only the standard functions read, malloc and free.

See .pdf subject for details.
